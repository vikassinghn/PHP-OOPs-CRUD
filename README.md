# 🧩 PHP CRUD Application (OOP Based)

## 📋 Overview
This project is a **PHP-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It demonstrates how to perform basic database operations in a structured and reusable way with classes and methods.

## ⚙️ Features
- Add new records  
- View all records  
- Update existing records  
- Delete records  
- Uses OOP principles like classes, objects, and methods  
- MySQL database integration
